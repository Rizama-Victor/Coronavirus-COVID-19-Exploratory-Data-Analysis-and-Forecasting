# COVID-19 🧬 Exploratory Data Analysis 📊 and Forecasting
This repository contains the implementation of my project titled _"COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis and Forecasting"_, at the National Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (NCAIR), Nigeria.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project explored global COVID-19 data covering `confirmed`, `recovered`, and `death` cases recorded between January 2020 and May 2021, categorized by country and province. The dataset provided key metrics reflecting the pandemic’s progression and its varying impact across regions. 
Using this data, the project aimed to perform an in-depth analysis and develop forecasting models to forecast future death cases in each province or state for every country.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- To develop a forecasting model using the COVID-19 data spanning January 2020 to May 2021.
- To perform an in-depth exploratory analysis of the dataset to uncover key insights and patterns related to the pandemic’s spread and impact.
