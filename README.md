## 🧠 Overview

This project explored global COVID-19 data covering `confirmed`, `recovered`, and `death` cases recorded between January 2020 and May 2021, categorized by country and province. The dataset provided key metrics reflecting the pandemic’s progression and its varying impact across regions. 
Using this data, the project aimed to perform an in-depth analysis and develop forecasting models to forecast future death cases in each province or state for every country.
